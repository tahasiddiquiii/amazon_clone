# amazon_clone
a full-stack e-commerce app (Amazon Clone) built with Flutter, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose! In this project, I had the opportunity to build the UI of Amazon from scratch using Flutter, a popular framework for building mobile and web applications.

and the UI was just the beginning. I also created REST APIs using Node.js and Express and stored the data in MongoDB using Mongoose, a powerful ODM library. Leveraging the power of API calls, I was able to connect the backend with the front end and create a seamless experience for users.

And with Flutter and Dart, I was able to use Models to consume these APIs and make them available in the app. I also utilized the Flutter State Management tool as a provider, which helped me manage the state of the app efficiently.

One of the most exciting aspects of this project was creating a cross-platform app that works on both Android and iOS. It was a challenging but rewarding experience to see my code working seamlessly on both platforms.

and most importantly I was able to host my website's backend server effortlessly on Render, without worrying about server management or high costs. With Render, you can focus on building your website while leaving the hosting to them. 

Overall, building this Amazon clone with Flutter, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose has been a great learning experience for me. I'm excited to share it with you all and to continue exploring the possibilities of full-stack development.
